                <br>
                <p2>This weekend, I gave alot of time to meeting new friends and spending time with the ones I already have. I felt very fulfilled and inspired by all of them, whether old friend or new.</p2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p2>Things that inspire me about my friends:</p2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p2>
                    -Brenna: She doesn't care what anyone thinks
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    -Dorothy: She is such a dreamer and has such a big heart
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    -Siena: She is so purely creative and adventurous. Our hearts are always in sync. She lives in Paris now but we facetime every other day to update eachother on life and creative ventures

                <p2>My best friend and I do weekly photoshoots. I've recently been working on my portfolio and i find myself being drawn, more and more to photography.</p2>

                <p>Summer blues</p>
                <p2>I took this photo of one of my best friends, Siena, when she visited me at home this summer. This was my second role of 35mm film ever.
                <br>
                <br>
                <p2>Siena and I spent the whole day talking, walking, swimming, and sneaking photos. This week maded my heart so warm, so it was very lovely to have photos to look back on. </p2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p2>3 weeks later, I got my film back and it came back in color! I really thought it was a B&W role but It was such a sweet surprise to see such good memories in color.</p2>

                    This summer, I added sunprinting to my artistic journey. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The process is actually quite easy! It begins with printing a negative on film paper, then you apply the blue formula to your desired surface. Then, move into a sunny space and place your negative over your dyed surface. Let sit for 15 minutes and then rinse in warm water.
